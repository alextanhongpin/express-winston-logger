# Logging best practice

+ log all the relevant information (req, headers, response body)
+ don't log sensitive information such as secret or password. blacklist them
+ store it in a readable format (json) for easy processing
+ autorotate your log file daily to prevent it from growing too large
+ trace errors in your log file
